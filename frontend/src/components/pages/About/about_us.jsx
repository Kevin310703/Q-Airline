              QAirline was founded in 1995 by a group of visionary entrepreneurs who saw the potential 
              to revolutionize air travel in our region. What started as a small, regional carrier 
              has grown into a national airline connecting millions of passengers each year.

            <p>
              In our early years, we operated with just two small aircraft, serving local routes. 
              By 2005, we had expanded to become a major domestic carrier, and in 2015, we launched 
              our first international routes, marking a significant milestone in our journey.
